# Project Title  
Routiner – Habit Tracker App 
# Problem Statement 
Many people, including myself, struggle to change bad habits and build good ones for 
personal growth. Most of us write our plans or goals on paper, but since we spend 
most of our time using our phones, those paper plans are often forgotten or ignored. 
This makes it hard to stay consistent and track our progress. 
The Routiner – Habit Tracker App aims to solve this problem by providing a digital 
way to plan, track, and maintain habits easily through a mobile app. 
# Objective 
The purpose of this app is to help users build and keep good habits by offering 
reminders, progress tracking, and motivational tools. It allows users to create their 
own goals, monitor their improvement, and stay motivated in their daily routines. 
# Reason for Choosing This Project 
I chose this project because I have seen myself and others struggling to change bad 
habits. We often make plans on paper but don’t follow them because we use our 
phones more often. Creating this app will make habit tracking easier, more 
organized, and more effective for personal growth. 
# Main Features 
This section shows the key functions that make the Routiner app useful and easy to 
use. 
• Add, edit, and delete habits 
• Mark habits as done 
• Daily reminders and notifications 
• Progress charts and streak counters 
• Dark and light mode 
• Motivational quotes or daily messages 
• Optional cloud backup using Firebase 
# Project Scope 
During this semester, we will begin by researching and designing the user interface in the first month, including defining the main features, choosing color schemes and icons in Figma, and writing documentation about the app’s purpose and target users. In the second month, we will focus on setting up the Android project with the MVVM architecture, configuring the Room database, and building the main screens such as Add Habit, Habit List, and Detail. Finally, in the third month, we will implement the core CRUD functions for habits, connect the ViewModel, Repository, and DAO, enable data saving and loading, and add the feature to mark habits as done.
# Tools and Technologies 
The main tools and software used to develop the app: 
• Android Studio: Used as the main IDE for developing and testing the mobile 
app. 
• Java/Kotlin: Programming languages used to write the app’s logic and 
functionality. 
• Firebase: Used for storing user data  
• Figma: Used to design the app’s user interface and layout before development.
