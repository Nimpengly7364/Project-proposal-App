# Project Title  
Routiner – Habit Tracker App 
# Problem Statement 
Many people, including myself, struggle to change bad habits and build good ones for 
personal growth. Most of us write our plans or goals on paper, but since we spend 
most of our time using our phones, those paper plans are often forgotten or ignored. 
This makes it hard to stay consistent and track our progress. 
The Routiner – Habit Tracker App aims to solve this problem by providing a digital 
way to plan, track, and maintain habits easily through a mobile app. 
# Objective 
The purpose of this app is to help users build and keep good habits by offering 
reminders, progress tracking, and motivational tools. It allows users to create their 
own goals, monitor their improvement, and stay motivated in their daily routines. 
# Reason for Choosing This Project 
I chose this project because I have seen myself and others struggling to change bad 
habits. We often make plans on paper but don’t follow them because we use our 
phones more often. Creating this app will make habit tracking easier, more 
organized, and more effective for personal growth.
