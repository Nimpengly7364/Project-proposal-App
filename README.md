# Project Title  
**Routiner – Habit Tracker App**


## 1. Problem Statement  

+ Many people struggle to change bad habits and build good ones for personal growth.  

- Most people write their plans or goals on paper, but since we spend most of our time on phones, those paper plans are often forgotten or ignored.  
- It becomes hard to stay consistent and track progress effectively.  

+ To solve this, we propose the **Routiner – Habit Tracker App**, which provides a simple and digital way to plan, track, and maintain habits through a mobile app.  


## 2. Objective  

The main goal of this app is to help users build and maintain good habits by offering reminders, progress tracking, and motivational tools. It allows users to:  

- Create and customize personal goals.  
- Monitor daily improvement easily.  
- Stay motivated with reminders and progress updates.  


## 3. Reason for Choosing This Project  

+ Many people, including myself, face difficulty maintaining consistency when trying to change bad habits.  
- Paper-based plans are often forgotten because we use our phones more frequently.  
- This app will make habit tracking easier, more organized, and more effective for personal growth.
